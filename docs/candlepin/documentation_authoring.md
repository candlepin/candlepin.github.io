# Candlepin Documentation
Candlepin documentation is split into three major pieces. A Jekyll based web site [https://candlepin.github.io/](https://candlepin.github.io/), JavaDoc that is currently only in the source code and REST API that is being hosted on [https://candlepin.github.io/](https://candlepin.github.io/) and is auto-generated by so called API Crawler (Java project in server's code base)

When you need to submit new documentation, you should clone sources of the site from  [Github repo](https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin.github.io) and issue a Pull Request. After your pull request is merged, the new site content is automatically published to [https://candlepin.github.io/](https://candlepin.github.io/)

While preparing the Pull Request with changes to the documentation you should use local Jekyll instance to see your changes to the documentation. See README.md file in site's sources.
