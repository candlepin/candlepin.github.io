# Candlepin Documentation

Candlepin documentation is split into three major pieces. A Jekyll based web
site [https://candlepinproject.org/](https://candlepinproject.org/), JavaDoc that is currently only in the
source code and REST API that is being hosted on [https://candlepinproject.org/](https://www.candlepinproject.org/docs/candlepin/swaggerapi.html)
and is auto-generated by OpenAPI from our API spec.

When you need to submit new documentation, you should clone sources of the site
from  [Github repo](https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin.github.io) and issue a Pull Request. After your
pull request is merged, the new site content is automatically published
to [https://candlepin.github.io/](https://candlepin.github.io/)

While preparing the Pull Request with changes to the documentation you should use local Jekyll instance to see
your changes to the documentation. See README.md file in site's sources.
