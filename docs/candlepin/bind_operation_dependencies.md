## Dependencies Description
 * ONE: We need to to lock pools before the entitlements are persisted as they hold references to the pools.
 * TWO: We need the entitlement id to create the entitlement derived pool, hence we persist the entitlement before we do that.
 * THREE: Decrementing any pool's quantity may cause us to revoke excess entitlements.
 * FOUR: Entitlement Id is needed in the certificate as it is used in the DN part of the cert
 * FIVE, SIX, SEVEN: All consumer's non read operations need to be complete before we compute it's compliance
