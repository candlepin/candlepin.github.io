# Auto Generating `candlepin.conf`

## Summary
If you want the buildconf/scripts/deploy script to auto-generate and install
your candlepin.conf file every time, then:

* Edit /etc/candlepin/candlepin.conf and place the word *AUTOGENERATED* in the first line of the file.  The deploy script will not overwrite your candlepin.conf otherwise.

  ```console
  $ sudo sh -c "echo '# AUTOGENERATED' | cat - /etc/candlepin/candlepin.conf > /tmp/c.out && mv -f /tmp/c.out /etc/candlepin/candlepin.conf"
  ```

* Edit your ~/.candlepinrc file and add the line

  ```bash
  AUTOCONF=1
  ```

* Run

  ```console
  $ bin/deploy
  ```

## The buildr erb task
I have created a buildr task that will automatically generate candlepin.conf
based on a template under `erb/` and values defined in `profiles.yaml` and
`custom.yaml`.  Simply run `buildr erb` and the buildr task will begin by
searching recursively for every *.erb file under the `erb/` directory.  Then
the task will load `custom.yaml` in the project base directory.  This file is
for you and you alone.  It is in `.gitignore` and is not meant to be checked
in.  For every *.erb file, simply create an entry in `custom.yaml` that is the
name of the template minus the ".erb" extension and then followed by a colon.
So for `candlepin.conf.erb`, your `custom.yaml` would initially look like

```yaml
candlepin.conf:
```

If you don't have an entry in `custom.yaml` for a particular template, then the
task will try and render the template anyway but it will warn you.

## Adding customizations
To add values for the template engine to substitute in, just declare them in
`custom.yaml`.  So for example, if you want to turn Candlepin's pretty printing
off in the `candlepin.conf.erb` template, your `custom.yaml` would look like

```yaml
candlepin.conf
  cp_pretty_print: "false"
```

There are a couple of things to note here.  First, white space is important in
[YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), so be sure to indent properly.
Secondly, make sure to wrap your values in quotes so
[YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) will treat them as strings.  If the
word "false" were not in quotes here, the [Ruby YAML
parser](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.8.6/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html) would
create an instance of FalseClass instead of String.  This is probably not what
you want since in Ruby the string "false" will evaluate to true while an
instance of the FalseClass will evaluate to false.

### Specifics on candlepin.conf.erb
The candlepin.conf.erb template has a few special properties.

* You can declare logging by creating a custom_logging declaration and then
  providing a hash of logger names to log levels.  Like so

  ```yaml
  candlepin.conf:
    custom_logging:
      "org.hibernate.SQL": "DEBUG"
      "org.candlepin.servlet.filter": "DEBUG"
  ```

  If you want to stop logging on a logger but leave it in the rendered
  candlepin.conf just put a hash sign in front of the logger name.  For example

  ```yaml
  candlepin.conf:
    custom_logging:
      "#org.hibernate.SQL": "DEBUG"
      "org.candlepin.servlet.filter": "DEBUG"
  ```

  will render to

  ```properties
  #log4j.logger.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
  log4j.logger.org.candlepin.servlet.filter=DEBUG
  ```

* You can drop any additional stuff into the template without modifying the
  template by using the additional_properties declaration which is followed by
  a pipe character.

  ```yaml
  candlepin.conf:
    additional_properties: |
      some.brand.new.property=foo
      some.other.new.property=bar
  ```

  will render to

  ```properties
  some.brand.new.property=foo
  some.other.new.property=bar
  ```

  The pipe character tells YAML that the following text is a
  [block](http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html#single_ending_newline).
* Many of the default values are read out of "profiles.yaml".  See below.

## The `buildconf/scripts/deploy` script
* The script is written so that the "buildr erb" task is only run if the deploy
  script is given the "-a" flag or your ~/.candlepinrc file has 

  ```bash
  AUTOCONF=1
  ```

* The script also accepts flags on which database to deploy to.  The flags are
  * `-m` for MySQL
  * `-o` for Oracle
* Under the covers these flags pass various information to the buildr erb task.

## Notes on `profiles.yaml`
* You specify buildr with a profile using the "-e" option.  Buildr then opens
  `profiles.yaml` and looks for a key matching your profile name.  All the
  values under that key are then loaded into Buildr's profile variable.  Let's
  suppose your `profiles.yaml` looks like this

  ```yaml
  postgresql:
    driver_class: "org.postgresql.Driver"

  oracle:
    driver_class: "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
  ```

  When running "buildr -e oracle" then `profile['driver_class']` would equal "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver".
* You can merge YAML hashes using the `<<` operator and aliases.

  ```yaml
  common: &common
    username: "candlepin"
    password: ""

  postgresql:
    <<: *common
    driver_class: "org.postgresql.Driver"
    jdbc_url: "jdbc:postgresql:candlepin"
    dialect: "org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect"
    quartz_driver: "org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.PostgreSQLDelegate"
  ```

  In this example, when building with `-e postgresql` you get the username
  and password values too.  The ampersand creates an alias to
  an item.  The `<<` merges two hashes, and the asterisk dereferences the
  alias.  See [here](http://viewsourcecode.org/why/redhanded/bits/yamlSMergeKey.html).

## Notes on Writing Templates
* If you are writing a block of Ruby use the `<%-` and `-%>` tags.  These tags
  enable ERB's trim mode so you don't leave a lot of extra white space.
* Profile values can be accessed through the profile function.

  ```erb
  <%= profile.password %>
  ```
* **Provide defaults**: use the `||` operator to provide a default in case the user has not specified a value in custom.yaml

  ```erb
  jpa.config.hibernate.show_sql=<%= show_hibernate || false %>
  ```
* If you need to write to a local variable in the template, use the provided
  "_" variable followed by a period and then what you want to call your
  variable.  Just declaring variables in the template scope runs the risk of
  overriding what was provided by the user.

  ```erb
  _.big_string = small_string.upcase
  ```
* Do not use Ruby's "or" operator with assignments.  It has a lower precedence
  than the assignment operator and so the value on the left of the "or" will
  always end up being assigned.  See
  [here](http://devblog.avdi.org/2010/08/02/using-and-and-or-in-ruby/)

  ```irb
  irb(main):003:0> x = nil or "bar"
  => "bar"
  irb(main):004:0> x
  => nil
  ```

  so

  ```erb
  _.my_val_with_default = my_val or "default"
  ```

  will be nil if my_val is not found in custom.yaml.
* If you need to manipulate a value from custom.yaml, but aren't sure if it's
  going to be there or not, use the get() function and pass it a block.  The
  block will be performed on the value if it is not nil, otherwise nil will be
  returned.

  ```erb
  <%= get("my_optional_value") { |v| v.upcase } || "some default" %>
  ```

  If you instead ran

  ```erb
  <%= my_optional_value.upcase || "some default" %>
  ```

  then you would get an error because you were dereferencing a nil.
* Pay attention to the names of the values you put in custom.yaml.  Because the
  ERB rendering class is running under Buildr, it gets polluted with a bunch of
  stuff that Buildr pulls in.  Consequently, some names may already be
  assigned.  If this is the case, the renderer will print out a warning but it
  will override the existing value.  For example for the YAML

  ```yaml
  candlepin.conf:
    pretty_print: blah
  ```

  You will see a warning reading

  ```
  pretty_print is already defined in ["/usr/share/ruby/pp.rb", 279].  Boldy overriding it!
  ```
