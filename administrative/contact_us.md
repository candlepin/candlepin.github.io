# Contact Us
Communication between Candlepin developers generally takes place using
the project mailing list or IRC (for real-time communication).

## Mailing Lists
The [Candlepin](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/candlepin)
mailing list has a low volume of traffic and includes both patches proposed for
inclusion and general discussion.

## Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
We use IRC for real time collaboration and support between developers.
